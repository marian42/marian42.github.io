This year I participated in my first game jam, the Global Game Jam 2018. With a team of artists, programmers and a sound designer, we made a video game within 48 hours. <!--more-->You play the game as a virus that infiltrates a company’s headquarters. The virus can not move on its own, it can only take control of hackable devices and use them to move around. There are six levels, each with a puzzle to move to the next one.
