This is one of my first 3D modeling projects in Blender and my biggest 3D modeling project so far.

It's a model of ESA's ExoMars rover.
You can have a closer look at the model on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/4148a592193549c59c778a69fd45df5a):

There is also a download option on Sketchfab so you can get the original .blend file and use it for anything you like!
