I made a procedural pixelart generator that is inspired by the art style of the upcoming space adventure game No Manâ€™s Sky.

Check it out and generate your own pixelart:

The art generator is written in javascript and uses noise functions such as simplex noise to generate procedural landscapes and other features. Whenever the page is loaded, a new random seed is selected and an artwork is generated based on this seed. As a consequence, it is extremely unlikely that the same planet is shown twice.
