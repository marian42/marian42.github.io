BTduino is an Android app that lets you add a custom bluetooth interface to your Arduino project without any programming on the Android side.

Everything is better with bluetooth! Here are some examples:

## Download

  * [Android APK file][1] Android 4.0 or higher is required.
  * [Arduino example sketch][2]
  * [Arduino sketch without examples][3]
  * [Source code][4]

<!--more-->To use this app, you need an Arduino or any microcontroller with a serial connection that you can program, a bluetooth module (about â‚¬10) and the parts for your project.

## Getting started

The app is designed to be self-explaining. Send values by sending a name, a colon and the value, all in text form. Take a look at the [example sketch for Arduino][2] for a quick start. There is a step-by-step [tutorial][5] that shows you how to control an LED and a potentiometer via bluetooth. All capabilities of BTduino are explained in the [documentation][6]. If anything goes wrong, check out the [troubleshooting page][7].

## Beta

I have tested this only with my own setup, so consider this a beta release. If you find a bug or want to request a feature, please [send me an email][8]. Also, just out of curiosity, please let me know if you used this for a project.
